# Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB-Reviews

Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie.

Right now movie enthusiasts need to write a review and give a star rating so analysts can track whether the review is good or bad.

By using Natural Language Processing, we can do sentiment analysis and generate the end result whether the review is positive or negative or neutral.

We will also be predicting the emotions from the reviews.

This will help saving time from reviewers and make the process automatic.

Such analysis can help movie PRâ€™s to understand the viewers choice with the help of words most appearing.
